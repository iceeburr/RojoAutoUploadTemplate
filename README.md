# PLEASE READ ⚠️
This template is no longer maintained, outdated and I personally consider it bad practice. This repository will be deleted soon. <br>
Please, use the new template at https://github.com/iceeburr/roblox-template <br>
It is much better, will actually be maintained and used in real games. <br>
If you see a label saying that it's not ready yet, that means I'm still in the process of finishing it. If you are still reading this, it's likely I haven't completed it yet. <br>
Thank you for your patience. <br>
A new dev forum post will be made as well.

# Template For Auto Publishing
Feel free to download the source of this repo to make it easier to set up your Roblox project.
More details are in the Tutorial [here.](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-to-automate-place-publishing-with-partially-managed-rojo/2443196)

## Caution!!
Trying to use `git clone https://github.com/iceeburr/RojoAutoUploadTemplate.git` will result in you cloning the whole repository WITH the .git files.
This will prevent you from changing the repository owner, unless you know how. This is why you should manually download it through the green "code" button and then "Download ZIP".
This will download the raw version without any of github's tracking files *(for exception,.gitignore).*
It's hard and confusing to link a pre-existing repository to git, so it's recommended that you use vscode to create and initialize the repository through the vscode source control tab, which will automatically link it for you and won't cause any issues. If you want to try, though, feel free to be up for a challenge.
