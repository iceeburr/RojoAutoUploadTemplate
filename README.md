## Caution!!
Trying to use `git clone https://github.com/iceeburr/RojoAutoUploadTemplate.git` will result in you cloning the whole repository WITH the .git files.
This will prevent you from changing the repository owner, unless you know how. This is why you should manually download it through the green "code" button and then "Download ZIP".
This will download the raw version without any of github's tracking files *(for exception,.gitignore).*
It's hard and confusing to link a pre-existing repository to git, so it's recommended that you use vscode to create and initialize the repository through the vscode source control tab, which will automatically link it for you and won't cause any issues. If you want to try, though, feel free to be up for a challenge.
